Hello, {user}, welcome to the Church of Minamoto Kou! <:KouBang:705054435667214367>
This is a small server dedicated to me, Minamoto Kou from the manga/anime Jibaku Sh≈çnen Hanako-kun (a.k.a. Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun). You can say I play a huge role in it! Go check out either the manga or the anime to see my amazing performance! <:KouHeh:712631800773738548>

Our server is fairly small, but we do have lots of fun stuffs, and of course, other friends including <@735245851856994464>, <@737017231522922556> and <@739877406151671821>! Make sure that you say hello to them as well!

Because there are not many members here, currently we don't really have specific rules. However, I'm a nice guy from the Minamoto family, and I hope we can all be nice here as well! So if you want to join this small but lovely server, common sense are important! Basically:

1. Be nice.
2. Refrain from name calling and verbally attacking other people.
3. Political talks are allowed, but the point 2 applies too. Be nice.
4. Refrain from talking about illegal downloads and pirated software/games.
5. Again, be nice. A rule of thumb is that if you don't want people to do the same thing to you, don't do this to them yourself, either.

I also provide some of fun stuffs! <:KouSugoi:705613007119450172>
The stuffs I provide can be classified into the following categories. Type each command's name to learn what they do! <:KouExcited:713920132216389632> You can also press the button at the bottom to see more fun stuffs!

Hello, {user}, welcome to {guildName}! <:TaigaSmug:702210822310723614>
This is a server dedicated to me, the great Taiga Akatora from [Camp Buddy from BLits Games](https://www.blitsgames.com/)!. I'm a major role in this yaoi visual novel, and I arguably have the best route among all routes, because I'm the best! <:TaigaDominate:699795360960348210>

When compared to other big servers, our server is not that large, but hey, I emphasize on quality over anything else, because I won't accept anything less here! We also have lots of fun stuffs here, make sure to check out each channel and say hello to others!

Since this server is closely related to Camp Buddy, we basically follow the same rule as Camp Buddy's official server here. Generally we are pretty chill, but I suggest you read rules in <#696686577602134126>; otherwise, my sidekick <@263348633280315395>, <@297195101753573380>, <@617978701962805249> and <@457393417287368706> will sure get to you! <:TaigaGun:703552167973224459>

You can also check [the official website of Camp Buddy](https://www.blitsgames.com/) and [the official Discord server](http://discord.gg/campbuddy)!

I also can do some fun stuffs! Thanks to <@297195101753573380>, <@677249244842950684>, and <@269450372404215808>, because it was them who introduced me here! If you have any questions or suggestion, don't hesitate to tell them then! I'll sure kick their asses if they don't listen! <:TaigaLOL:700004692079542333>
